This repo contains libhal compatible libraries for numerous ARM Cortex-M
processor microcontrollers (MCUs). This is a platform library supporting
generic ARM processor APIs and peripheral drivers from many different
microcontrollers.

## üìö Software APIs & Usage

To learn about the available drivers and APIs see the headers
[`include/libhal-arm-mcu`](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-arm-mcu/tree/main/include/libhal-arm-mcu)
directory.

To see how each driver is used see the
[`demos/`](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-lpc40/tree/main/demos) directory.

Fully rendered Doxygen APIs will be provided when
[issue#37](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-arm-mcu/issues/37) is closed.

## üß∞ Setup

To get started with libhal, follow the
[üöÄ Getting Started](https://libhal.github.io/3./getting_started/) guide.

## üì° Installing Profiles

Profiles define which platform you mean to build your project against. These
profiles are needed for code and demos in this repo and for applications that
wish to execute on an arm mcu supported by this library. The following will
install the conan profiles for arm mcus and the compiler.

```bash
conan config install -sf conan/profiles/v1 -tf profiles https://github.com/libhal/arm-gnu-toolchain.git
conan config install -sf conan/profiles/v1 -tf profiles https://github.com/libhal/libhal-arm-mcu.git
```

Note that running these commands multiple times is safe. The command will
simply overwrite the old files with the latest files.

## üèóÔ∏è Building Demos

To build demos, start at the root of the repo and execute the following command:

```bash
conan build demos -pr lpc4078 -s build_type=Debug
```

This will build the demos for the `lpc4078` microcontroller in `Debug` mode.
Replace `lpc4078` with any of the other complete profiles found in the
`./conan/profiles/v1/`. Incomplete profiles do not match an exact device such
as `lpc40` or `stm32f1`.

## üíæ Flashing/Programming

There are a few ways to flash an LPC40 series MCU. The recommended methods are
via USB or using a debugger JTAG/SWD.

### Flashing NXP MCUs

[`nxpprog`](https://github.com/libhal/nxpprog) is a script for programming and
flashing LPC40 series chips over serial/UART. Using it will require a USB to
serial/uart adaptor.

See the README on [`nxpprog`](https://github.com/libhal/nxpprog), for details on
how to use NXPPROG.

To install nxpprog:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U nxpprog
```

To flash command is:

```bash
nxpprog --control --binary demos/lpc4078/blinker.elf.bin --device /dev/tty.usbserial-10
```

- Replace `demos/lpc4078/blinker.elf.bin` with the path to the binary you'd like
  to flash.
- Replace `/dev/tty.usbserial-10` with the path to your serial port on your
  machine.

### Flashing STM32 Processors

[`stm32loader`](https://pypi.org/project/stm32loader/) is a script for
programming and flashing STM32 series chips over serial/UART. Using it will
require a USB to serial/uart adaptor.

For more information, please refer to the README of
[`stm32loader`](https://pypi.org/project/stm32loader/).

To install stm32loader:

```bash
python3 -m pip install stm32loader
```

To flash command is:

```bash
stm32loader -p /dev/tty.usbserial-10 -e -w -v demos/build/stm32f103c8/Debug/blinker.elf.bin
```

- Replace `demos/build/stm32f103c8/Debug/blinker.elf.bin` with the path to the
  binary you'd like to flash.
- Replace `/dev/tty.usbserial-10` with the path to your serial port on your
  machine.

### Using JTAG/SWD over PyOCD

`PyOCD` is a debugging interface for programming and also debugging ARM Cortex M
processor devices over JTAG and SWD.

This will require a JTAG or SWD debugger. The recommended debugger for the
LPC40 series of devices is the STLink v2 (cheap variants can be found on
Amazon).

See [PyOCD Installation Page](https://pyocd.io/docs/installing) for installation
details.

For reference the flashing command is:

```bash
pyocd flash --target lpc4088 demos/build/lpc4078/Debug/blinker.elf.bin
pyocd flash --target stm32f103rc demos/build/stm32f103c8/Debug/blinker.elf.bin
```

Note that the targets for your exact part may not exist in `pyocd`. Because of
this, it means that the bounds of the memory may not fit your device. It is up
to you to make sure you do not flash a binary larger than what can fit on your
device.

## üì¶ Adding `libhal-arm-mcu` to your project

This section assumes you are using the
[`libhal-starter`](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-starter)
project.

Make sure to add the following options and default options to your app's
`ConanFile` class:

```python
    options = {"platform": ["ANY"]}
    default_options = {"platform": "unspecified"}
```

Add the following to your `requirements()` method:

```python
    def requirements(self):
        self.requires("libhal-arm-mcu/[^1.0.0]")
```

The version number can be changed to whatever is appropriate for your
application. If you don't know, using the latest is usually a good choice.

The CMake from the starter project will already be ready to support the new
platform library. No change needed.

To perform a test build simple run `conan build` as is done above with the
desired target platform profile.

## üèÅ Startup & Initialization

Startup is managed by the [`picolibc`](https://keithp.com/picolibc/) runtime.
In terms of startup `picolibc` has to manage doing two things. For one, it must construct a minimal interrupt vector table with two entries. The 1st entry is the address of the top of the stack. The 2nd entry is the address of the function that will be executed on reset. `picolibc` sets this to its own `_start` function. `_start` does the following:

1. Sets the main stack registers
2. Write the `.data` section from read-only memory
3. Set the `.bss` section to all zeros
4. Enable FPU if present for the core architecture
5. Calls all globally constructed C++ objects
6. Calls `main()`

If the `.data` or `.bss` sections must initialized manually, there are functions
provided:

```C++
#include <libhal-armcortex/startup.hpp>

hal::cortex_m::initialize_data_section();
hal::cortex_m::initialize_bss_section();
hal::cortex_m::initialize_floating_point_unit();
```

### üèéÔ∏è Setting Clock Speed

To setting the CPU clock speed to the maximum of 120MHz, include the line below,
with the rest of the includes:

```C++
#include <libhal-arm-mcu/lpc40/clock.hpp>
#include <libhal-arm-mcu/stm32f1/clock.hpp>
#include <libhal-arm-mcu/stm32f4/clock.hpp>
// etc..
#include <libhal-arm-mcu/rp2040/clock.hpp>
```

Next run the following command but replace `12.0_MHz` with the crystal
oscillator frequency connected to the microcontroller. This command REQUIRES
that there be a crystal oscillator attached to the microcontroller. Calling
this without the oscillator will cause the device to freeze as it will attempt
to use a clock that does not exist.

```C++
hal::lpc40::maximum(12.0_MHz);
hal::stm32f1::maximum(8.0_MHz);
hal::stm32f4::maximum(10.0_MHz);
// etc...
hal::rp2040::maximum(16.0_MHz);
```

To set the clock rate to the max speed using the internal oscillator:

```C++
hal::lpc40::maximum_speed_using_internal_oscillator();
hal::stm32f1::maximum_speed_using_internal_oscillator();
hal::stm32f4::maximum_speed_using_internal_oscillator();
// etc...
hal::rp2040::maximum_speed_using_internal_oscillator();
```

These APIs may not always exist for all systems, so be sure to check if the API
exists.

#### üï∞Ô∏è Detailed Clock Tree Control

## üîé On Chip Software Debugging

### Using PyOCD (‚úÖ RECOMMENDED)

In one terminal:

```bash
pyocd gdbserver --target=lpc4088 --persist
```

In another terminal:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gdb demos/build/lpc4078/blinker.elf -ex "target remote :3333"
```

Replace `demos/build/lpc4078/blinker.elf` with the path to the elf file you'd
like to use for the debugging session.

### Using OpenOCD

Coming soon... (its more complicated)
