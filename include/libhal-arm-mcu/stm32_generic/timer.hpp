 * across different STM32 series. It is intended to be used by series-specific
 * implementations, which handle MCU-specific configuration details and pass
 * any required parameters to these generic functions.

   * series-specific implementations of the timer, the address is deduced from
   * the timer, as well as all the interrupt configuration is done, then they
   * are passed to initialize.
   *
   * If this constructor is used, it is unsafe to call any API of this class
   * before calling the `initialize()` API with the correct inputs. Once that
