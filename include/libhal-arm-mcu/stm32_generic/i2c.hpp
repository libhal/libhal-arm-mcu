   * @brief Construct a new i2c object

   * and cannot power on the i2c peripheral. Accessing the peripheral's
   * registers without it be powered on (or provided a clock), will result in a
   * memory fault as the peripheral cannot ACK the CPU when it attempts to
   * access the peripheral's registers. The power management system for each
   * peripheral across the stm32 series of MCUs is different, meaning its not
   * something that can efficiently be manged by this generic driver.
   *
   * Things that needed to be done before construction:
   *
   * 1. Configure pins to be controlled by the i2c peripheral pointed to by the
   *    `p_peripheral_address` input parameter.
   * 2. Power on the appropriate i2c peripheral
   *
   * After construction, execute the `configure()` function with the appropriate
   * peripheral frequency and i2c settings.
   *
   * Performing these in this order will properly initialize the i2c driver and
   * allow the usage of the `transfer()` API. Failing to execute these steps in
   * this order will result in UB.
   *
   * NOTE: why does this driver get away with breaking the rule about
   * construction means initialization? Because its constructor is marked unsafe
   * meaning care needs to be taken when using this.
